Untill now I had been using the standard terminal that comes with elementary os.
Of course this was usable and a nice experience but I began to notice its multiple 
limitations. 

Therefore I have started experimenting with the called DeepinTerminal.
Seems to be of chinese origin. I think I couldn-t be happier with it. 
The level of customization one can get out of it is almost MacOS Terminal-like.

It could even get better, I could make even more tweaks to transform this machine into 
an authentic productivity beast.

FURTHER COMMENTS WILL BE FOUND ON THE LOGS.
