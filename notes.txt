The file config.fish was renamed:
  config.fish -> my_config.fish

The new file config.fish is used to correctly set
the env for miniconda. On my final install, I'll replace
miniconda3 with a full conda installation, therefore
that file will change too.

I'm not sure what went wrong. I'm modifying this to create 
an artificial commit and wipe everything, start fresh.
